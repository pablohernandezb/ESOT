# A sequence starts when there is a positive change of a certain
# threshold (start_incl). It ends according to one of the following
# conditions:
#  - Single unit decrease past a threshold (year_turn)
#  - Cumulative decrease over a period where there is no change over
#    the starting threshold (start_incl)
#  - No further changes over the starting threshold (start_incl) for a
#    fixed period of time (tolerance)
#  - Missing value
#  - v2x_regime reverts to 0
